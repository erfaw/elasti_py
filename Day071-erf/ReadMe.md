# Where is Project ?
as long as i need to Host today project to a free hosting provider, (like Render.com or Pythonanywhere.com) i needed to make a individual repo for today project, with this link: **[Day071-erf](https://github.com/erfaw/elasti_py-Day071-erf-Deploy-Blog-Site)**

That is a Copy of Day069-erf in order to Deploy on Render.com .
